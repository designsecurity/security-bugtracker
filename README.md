## Prerequisites

Clone security-bugtracker into a temporary directory of your choice (`tmp-security-bugtracker` below):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/designsecurity/security-bugtracker tmp-security-bugtracker
```

### Webissues installation
Security-bugtracker is just a plugin of the awesome [webissues](https://github.com/mimecorg/webissues) bugtracker.  
Clone webissues repository into a web server directory of your choice (`/srv/www/htdocs/webissues` below):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mimecorg/webissues /srv/www/htdocs/webissues
cd /srv/www/htdocs/webissues
npm install
npm run build:web
```

Go to http://localhost/webissues/setup/install.php to configure webissues.

### OpenVAS plugin installation

[OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/) is the only mandatory security tool to install, security-bugtracker is deeply integrated with it, OpenVAS 9.0.1 or higher is necessary. Then, edit the OpenVAS-plugin configuration file [*tmp-security-bugtracker/security_tools/openvas/openvas.conf.php*](./security_tools/openvas/openvas.conf.php) with the required informations (look a the comments in this file for more help).  

## Configuration

*Merge* webissues and security-bugtracker with the chosen directory (step 1 of the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)) as argument of the install.sh utility:
```shell
cd tmp-security-bugtracker
./install.sh security-plugin /srv/www/htdocs/webissues/
```

Go to http://localhost/webissues/client/securityplugin.php to finalize the configuration:
- **openvas_ws_login**: is the login of the openvas webservice (the same than *$CONF_WS_OPENVAS_LOGIN* defined during the [OpenVAS plugin installation](#openvas-plugin-installation))
- **openvas_ws_password**: is the password of the openvas webservice (the same than *$CONF_WS_OPENVAS_PASSWORD* defined during the [OpenVAS plugin installation](#openvas-plugin-installation))
- **openvas_ws_endpoint**: is the url address of the openvas webservice (the same address than *$CONF_OPENVAS_ALERT_URL* defined during the [OpenVAS plugin installation](#openvas-plugin-installation))
- **type_folder_bugs**: is the id of the "folder type bugs" used by OpenVAS, by default it's 2.


*Copy* security-bugtracker OpenVAS plugin to the directory of your choice (can be on another server):
```shell
cd tmp-security-bugtracker
./install.sh openvas-services /srv/www/htdocs/openvas-services/
```

## Run security scans

### With SOAP-UI

Use your favorite SOAP client to request security bugtracker webservices:

When OpenVAS scan will end, corresponding issues will be automatically added to bugs folder of your newly project:

### With a script

Some scripts are available in the [security_tools/jobs](./security_tools/jobs) folder to automate large security scans.  
For instance [run_openvas.php](./security_tools/jobs/run_openvas.php) script will read all assets (ips, hostnames, corresponding projects) from text files in the [data](./security_tools/jobs/data/) folder and create "*projects*" in security-bugtracker, "*servers* issues", "*web* issues" (hostnames) and "*scans* issues" (therefore OpenVAS scans will be automatically started with all this data).
